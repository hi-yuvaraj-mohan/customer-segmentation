# customer-segmentation
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their behavior and demographics to enable targeted marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance business decision-making.

📊 Problem Statement
